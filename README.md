# _Jeopardy!_

## Description

_Jeopardy!_ is a front-end game inspired by the homonymous American quiz game show, which features 30 clues of 6 categories for contestants to respond in the form of a question.

But the game, despite working similarly to the show, offers users questions to answer instead.
